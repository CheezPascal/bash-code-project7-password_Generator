Password Generator
-------------------------------

Making a password generator application 

This is a simple password generator program in shell, i intentd to adapt this into HTML later and add this to a list of tools that i intend to host on a web page. 

in my usual style, i like to make the code output pretty, however the most important part are lines 9-11
